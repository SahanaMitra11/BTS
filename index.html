			<p> BTS (Hangul: Î∞©ÌÉÑÏÜåÎÖÑÎã®; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band formed in Seoul in 2013. The name became a backronym for Beyond the Scene in July 2017. The septet co-writes and produces much of their output. Initially rooted in hip hop, BTS' musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline. Popular for their live performances, the group has staged several world tours.

				The group initially formed as teenagers under Big Hit Entertainment and released their debut single album, 2 Cool 4 Skool (2013). Subsequent work such as their first U.S. Billboard 200 entries The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2 (2015), The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever (2016), and Wings (2016) helped establish BTS' reputation as a socially conscious group. Wings became BTS' first album to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the international music market, leading the Korean Wave into the United States and breaking numerous sales records, becoming the first Korean group to receive a certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) with their single "Mic Drop." The band is the first and only Korean act as of 2019 to top the U.S. Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018) and have since hit the top of the U.S. charts with their albums Love Yourself: Answer (2018) and Map of the Soul: Persona (2019), making BTS the first group since The Beatles to earn three number one albums in less than a year. Love Yourself: Answer also broke South Korea's Gaon Album Chart's all-time monthly record previously set by Love Yourself: Tear and became the first Korean album certified Gold in the United States.

																																																											<hr>
																																																											<h1> RM Namjoon <h1>
																																																													<img src='https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/5nRPPIfrmHOe.png?o=1'>
																																																													<p> RM's Tinytan character was designed to reflect his "charisma". There's a good reason or rather, several good reasons why RM is known as BTS's ‚ÄúCharismatic Leader‚Äù. Whether he‚Äôs rapping on stage or talking in an interview, he always has the most compelling charm.
																																																													<p>
																																																														<hr>
																																																													<h1> Jin <h1>
																																																															<img src='https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/jBhyu2pWfeVJ.png?o=1'>
																																																															<p> The focal point for Jin's Tinytan character was his "signature ending pose". If there's one thing "Mr. Worldwide Handsome" Jin is known for always doing on stage, it's his famous flying kiss that drives fans crazy. So, incorporating it into the animation was an essential.
																																																															<p>
																																																																<hr>

																																																																				<hr>
																																																																			<h1> Jimin <h1>
																																																																					<img src='https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/T2t5X09symEE.png?o=1'>
																																																																					<p> The focal point for Jimin's Tinytan character was his ‚Äúcute scene of sitting on dough‚Äú. Not only is Jimin known for his adorable features and attitude, dough is a particular apt motif for him because of his best-known nickname: ‚ÄúMochi‚Äù.
																																																																					<p>
																																																																						<hr>
																																																																					<h1> V <h1>
																																																																							<img src='https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/rKNGBOUr8mFw.png?o=1'>

If Jungkook didn‚Äôt decide to become a singer, he could‚Äôve easily been an artist. He‚Äôs known for creating some truly unique pieces that go beyond pencil and paper, from painted sneakers to customized gas masks.
